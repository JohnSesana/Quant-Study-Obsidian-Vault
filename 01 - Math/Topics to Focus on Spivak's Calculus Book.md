## ✅ **Master These (Crucial for Quants)**

These are the topics that directly build intuition and mathematical maturity you'll absolutely need:

1. **Limits and Continuity**
    
    - Epsilon-delta definitions, properties of limits, continuity theorems
        
    - Why: This is foundational for all of analysis, optimization, and stochastic calculus.
        
2. **Derivatives**
    
    - Definition, rules, mean value theorem, Taylor's theorem
        
    - Why: You’ll need to be comfortable with rate-of-change concepts in models, especially for optimization and differential equations.
        
3. **Applications of Derivatives**
    
    - Optimization problems, concavity, related rates
        
    - Why: Optimization is at the heart of quant strategies, risk management, pricing models.
        
4. **Integrals and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**
    
    - Riemann sums, definite/indefinite integrals
        
    - Why: Core for understanding expectation, area under curves, and later topics like Ito integrals.
        
5. **Techniques of Integration (basic)**
    
    - Integration by parts, substitution, partial fractions (but don’t overdo complex ones)
        
    - Why: Essential for applied problems, even though many will be done numerically later.
        
6. **Series and Convergence**
    
    - Infinite series, convergence tests, power series
        
    - Why: Necessary for understanding models in stochastic processes, numerical methods, and Taylor expansions.

## ☑️ **Skim/Understand Conceptually (Nice-to-Have but Don't Dwell Too Long)**

Still valuable, especially for deepening understanding, but not always immediately applicable:

1. **Precise Logic & Proofs Early On**
    
    - Good to get a taste but don’t spend too long unless you're weak in proofs.
        
2. **Functions (Section 1–2)**
    
    - Skim unless you're rusty with set theory/function notation
        
3. **Advanced Techniques of Integration**
    
    - Like trigonometric integrals or tricky substitutions—not crucial to master in full
        
4. **Formal ε-δ proofs for every limit**
    
    - Understand 2-3 well, but don’t get lost trying to prove every single one from scratch

## ❌ **Can Skip (for Now or Entirely for a Quant Track)**

These are either too theoretical or not really applicable in quant finance:

1. **Detours into Number Theory or Irrationality Proofs**
    
    - Nice math but not relevant unless you're aiming for pure math
        
2. **Spivak’s Historical Asides and Digressions**
    
    - Fun but not essential if your goal is efficiency
        
3. **The Appendices (unless reviewing prerequisites)**
    
    - These are review materials mostly
