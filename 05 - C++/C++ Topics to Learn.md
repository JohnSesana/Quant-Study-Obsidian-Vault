## 🧱 C++ for Quant Research – Learning Roadmap

### ✅ 1. **Core C++ Fundamentals**

You need _rock-solid understanding_ of these:

- Variables, types, operators
- Control structures (if, loops, switch)
- Functions and scope
- Arrays, strings
- Pointers and references ⚠️ (critical)

> 🎯 Goal: Comfortably write and debug simple programs involving math logic, arrays, and functions.

---

### 🧰 2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

- Classes and objects
- Constructors, destructors
- Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- Operator overloading


> 🎯 Goal: Build reusable components like a `Matrix`, `Option`, `Portfolio`, etc.

---

### 🧠 3. **Memory Management**

- Stack vs heap
- `new` / `delete`
- Smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`)
- Avoiding memory leaks & segfaults

> 🎯 Goal: Understand how C++ gives you control over performance and resources.

---

### 🧮 4. **Numerical Computing**

- Math functions, random number generators
- Matrix operations (you can write your own or use libraries)
- Floating-point precision pitfalls
- Monte Carlo simulations

> 🎯 Goal: Build simulation engines or option pricing tools from scratch.

---

### 📚 5. **Standard Template Library (STL)**

- Vectors, maps, sets, stacks, queues
- Algorithms: `sort()`, `find()`, `accumulate()`
- Iterators & range-based loops

> 🎯 Goal: Use STL containers efficiently like you use Pandas in Python.

---

### ⏱ 6. **Performance Optimization**

- Compile-time vs run-time behavior
- Inlining, const correctness
- Templates
- Profiling and benchmarking
- Writing cache-efficient code

> 🎯 Goal: Think in terms of speed — you’re optimizing for microseconds.

---

### 📦 7. **Libraries for Quants**

- **QuantLib** (open source) – pricing, instruments, calendars, etc.
- **Boost** – extensive utilities used in finance (math, stats, dates, etc.)
- **Armadillo** / **Eigen** – linear algebra libraries
- **Cereal** / **protobuf** – serialization (for storing models/data)

---

### 🔄 8. **Interfacing Python with C++**

- `pybind11` or `boost::python` to create Python bindings to C++ code
- Ideal for using high-performance C++ modules in your Python workflows

> 🎯 Goal: Prototype in Python → productionize in C++

---

## 🧪 Project Ideas for Practice

- Build a **Monte Carlo option pricing** simulator (Black-Scholes / Heston)
- Implement a **binomial/trinomial tree** for options
- Create a **Matrix class** with basic linear algebra ops
- Implement a **back testing engine** using C++
- Write a **custom random number generator** and compare with stdlib
- Build a toy **limit order book simulator**

## 🧠 Bonus: Interview-Style Practice

- Practice coding without STL (raw arrays, manual memory)
- Do LeetCode-style problems in C++ (focus: arrays, pointers, recursion)
- Know `Big-O` analysis, memory tradeoffs
- Understand how to implement hash maps, queues, stacks
